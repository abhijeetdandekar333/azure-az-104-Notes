Roles and administrators:
Role based access control (RBAC):
Security feature that is used to grant specific permissions to user groups or applications based on their roles
in your organizations.

In order for a user to interact with a resource in Azure it needs permission.
e.g. grant user to READ_ACCESS to storage account

Roles like Developer role, IT Operations role etc.

We can assign 2 different toles to single user.
And we assign the permissions to the role not directly to the user.
And assign that role to the user.
So this avoids giving thousands of permission to individual user.
(i.e. managing at the role level not individual level.)

All users treated the same for role and no secret extra permissions.
Easier for new users added to the system to be assigned the correct permissions.
