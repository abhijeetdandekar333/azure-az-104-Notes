Azure Resource Manager (ARM): 
Steps for creating a template for VM:
1. Need to go creating a VM using portal, enter all the details and then download the template.
2. Make changes if you want in template.
3. On azure portal search for templates and open Template specs on azure portal.
4. Import the template.

Its a central deployment model which is like AWS Cloudformation.
Its used for resource automation.
Schema is fixed.
ContentVersion used to version ARM templates.
Parameters are the variables that can be passed into the templates.
variables are basically parameters but they come from inside. i.e. they are a fixed string and they are not passed 
from outside.
resources contains array of one or more resources that we want to deploy.
outputs 

Read an ARM Template:
        {
            "name": "[parameters('networkSecurityGroupName')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups",
            "apiVersion": "2019-02-01",
            "location": "[parameters('location')]",
            "properties": {
                "securityRules": "[parameters('networkSecurityGroupRules')]"
            }
        },
        Here, [parameters()] allows us to get the defined parameters.
        like location we have defined as eastus2 
        type is the type of resource that we are gong to create.
Also, we can add dependency using depends_on for the resources.

ARM using powershell:
First Upload the template and parameters file on Azure built-in powershell->
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -TemplateFile 'template.json' -ResourceGroupName 'vm-arm' -TemplateParameterFile 'parameters.json'

ARM Custom Script Extensions:
https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates -> Link
Lets say we are using ARM template to deploy a windows or Linux virtual machine.
So we need to do furthur configurations to install softwares and all.
So for that we have a option of custom script extensions that can be deployed using arm 
that will execute a script after thr VM is deployed.

Alternative to custom script extension is to use existing VHD.
