Domain Name System(DNS):
Its like a phone directory to internet.
e.g. Domain name like microsoft.com gets turned into 40.112.72.205 IP address.
IP address is used by computers or servers to communicate with each other.

Azure provides DNS(default) :
No configuration required.
Can use hostnames to connect to machines on same VNet.
A VM can refer to another VM on the same network just by its hostname without requiring a fully-qualified domain name.

Azure Private DNS:
Create your own custom domain names and have them recognized by your VMs.
i.e. dev.local, staging.local, production.local.
Only valid on your own virtual network.
Not valid on the internet
Doesnt have to be registered or valid domain
