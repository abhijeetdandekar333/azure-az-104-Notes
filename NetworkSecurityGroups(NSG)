NSG is a filter which either allows or denies traffic travelling over the network to reach its intended destination.
It is attached to Virtual Machine.
NSG works for both traffic coming into the subnet and going out of the subnet.
We can add allow and deny rules.
We can have two NSGs combined one at subnet level and other at VM lebel attached to network interface But it is
a bad practice and increases complexity.

e.g. there are three rules one with priority 65000 which allows Vnet outbound traffic, 2nd with priority of 
65001 which allows internet outbound and 3rd is 65500 which denies all outbound traffic, then
all the traffic for 1st two rules will be allowed and except that traffic other traffic will be denied.


Application Security Groups:
Set destination in NSG as the private ip of the VM. so that traffic will only go to that VM over
ort 80(http) or port 443(https) from any source. but its complex to understand so we use application security group.
We need to create ASG and add VM to ASG. and edit the NSG that we have created add add the ASG in it while creatung the rule.
